      <h1>Site Design - Chapter 1: Foundation Principles</h1>
      
      <div class="content-section implementation-background">
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." - Ernest Hemingway
        </p>
        <p>
          In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with design, and design was fundamental. 
          Our approach to site design follows classical principles rooted in both scripture and timeless literature.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote class="highlight">
          "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 
          in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." - Proverbs 3:5-6
        </blockquote>

      <div class="content-section solution-background">
        <h2>User Experience Foundations</h2>
        <p>
          Like Dante's journey through the Divine Comedy, every user's path through our site 
          should be purposeful and guided. We design not just interfaces, but experiences 
          that lead users toward their goals with clarity and grace.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Core Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarity above cleverness</li>
          <li>Purpose-driven navigation</li>
          <li>Accessibility as a moral imperative</li>
          <li>Performance as respect for user time</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section experimental-background">
        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>
          "What we see depends mainly on what we look for." - John Lubbock
        </p>
        <p>
          Typography, color, and spacing work together like a well-orchestrated symphony. 
          Each element must serve the greater composition while maintaining its individual voice.
        </p>
