# Changelog


## [0.07] - 2025-07-08

### Added
- **Conditional Astro Configuration**: Dynamic base path handling for development vs production
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automatic deployment workflow using GitHub Actions

### Changed
- **astro.config.mjs**: Base path now conditional based on NODE_ENV
  - Local dev: No base path, works at `http://localhost:4321`
  - Production: Uses `/backgrounds/` base path for GitHub Pages
- **Site Configuration**: Updated for proper GitHub Pages deployment

### Fixed
- **Local Development 404 Issue**: Base path `/backgrounds/` was breaking local development
- **Development/Production Sync**: Hard reset required to sync local Windows version with GitHub updates

### Technical Notes
- **Hard Reset Required**: Local environments needed `git reset --hard HEAD` to sync with GitHub
- **Base Path Issue**: Production base path `/backgrounds/` was causing 404 errors in local development
- **Solution**: Conditional configuration using `process.env.NODE_ENV` to handle both environments

### Deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: https://kellytom.github.io/backgrounds/
