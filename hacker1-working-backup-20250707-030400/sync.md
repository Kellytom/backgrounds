Yes, using GitHub Desktop on Windows is a good option if you want to manage your Git repositories with a graphical interface and keep working in your Linux/WSL or Codespaces workspace for coding.

Hereâ€™s how you can combine both:

Use GitHub Desktop on Windows to sync (pull/push/clone) your repositories between GitHub and your H: drive or other Windows folders.
Continue editing and running code in your Linux/WSL environment or Codespaces workspace as usual.
You can copy files between your Linux workspace and your Windows folders (e.g., using /mnt/h for the H: drive in Linux).
This approach lets you:

Avoid switching shells just to use Git.
Use the best tools for each task: graphical Git on Windows, and full Linux tools for development.
If you want to keep everything in sync, just make sure to copy or move files between your Linux workspace and your Windows folders as needed. Let me know if you want step-by-step instructions for this workflow!
