Here in Guadalajara we have a nonprofit called The Rhizome Center for Migrants: "Our Mexico Project serves and defends the rights of the returned and deported". They have helped a lot of deportees get their documents in order, education certification transferred to Mexico, job postings, etc. You can search for them on Facebook. And on instagram it's therhizomecenter. Guadalajara is a metro area of 5 million and might be a good place for employment. Also, there may be similar organizations where you are located now.

Edit: I would add that Guadalajara also has the advantage of being within easy bus distance of your family in Michoac√°n.


 C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early
1960'ies, called "Parkinson's Law", which contains a lot of insight
into the dynamics of management.

You can find it on Amazon, and maybe also in your dads book-shelf,
it is well worth its price and the time to read it either way,
if you like Dilbert, you'll like Parkinson.

Somebody recently told me that he had read it and found that only
about 50% of it applied these days.  That is pretty darn good I
would say, many of the modern management books have hit-rates a
lot lower than that, and this one is 35+ years old.

In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the
age of the book.

Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will
be tangled up in endless discussions.

Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast,
so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody
else checked all the details before it got this far.   Richard P.
Feynmann gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,
examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.
